            <h3>Top 5 Tips for Securing Your Home Network</h3>
            <p>
                In this article, I share practical tips for securing your home network and protecting your personal data from cyber threats.
            </p>
        </article>

            <h2>Secure Routing Devices and Keep Them Up-to-Date</h2>
            <p>
                Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) may provide a modem/router as part of your service contract. To maximize administrative control over the routing and wireless features of your home network, consider using a personally owned routing device that connects to the ISP-provided modem/router. In addition, use modern router features to create a separate wireless network for guests, for network separation from your more trusted and private devices.
            </p>
            <!-- Add more paragraphs for each tip -->
            <p>
                Your router is the gateway into your home network. Without proper security and patching, it is more likely to be compromised, which can lead to the compromise of other devices on the network as well. To minimize vulnerabilities and improve security, the routing devices on your home network should be updated to the latest patches, preferably through automatic updates. These devices should also be replaced when they reach end-of-life (EOL) for support. This ensures that all devices can continue to be updated and patched as vulnerabilities are discovered.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Implement WPA3 or WPA2 on the Wireless Network</h2>
            <p>
                Wireless networks are susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access if not properly secured. Enable Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) or WPA2 encryption on your wireless network to encrypt communications and prevent unauthorized users from accessing your network. Use strong, unique passphrases and enable protected management frames for added security. To keep your wireless communications confidential, ensure your personal or ISP-provided WAP is capable of Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3). If you have devices on your network that do not support WPA3, you can select WPA2/3 instead. This allows newer devices to use the more secure method while still allowing older devices to connect to the network over WPA2.
            </p>
                        
            <h2>Implement Wireless Network Segmentation</h2>
            <p>
                Leverage network segmentation on your home network to keep your wireless communication secure. At a minimum, your wireless network should be segmented between your primary Wi-Fi, guest Wi-Fi, and IoT network. This segmentation keeps less secure devices from directly communicating with your more secure devices.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Employ Firewall Capabilities</h2>
            <p>
                Ensure that your personally owned routing device supports basic firewall capabilities. Verify that it includes network address translation (NAT) to prevent internal systems from being scanned through the network boundary. Wireless access points (WAP) generally do not provide these capabilities so it may be necessary to purchase a router. If your ISP supports IPv6, ensure your router supports IPv6 firewall capabilities.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Leverage Security Software</h2>
            <p>
                Consider installing comprehensive security software on all devices connected to your home network to detect and prevent malware, phishing attempts, and other cyber threats. Use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible. Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts.
